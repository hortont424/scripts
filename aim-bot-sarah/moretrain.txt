Dearest darlingest Momsie and Popsicle:
My dear Father:
There's been some confusion
Over rooming here at Shiz:
But of course, I'll care for Nessa:
But of course, I'll rise above it:
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond
Yes
There's been some confusion
For you see, my roommate is:
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe:
Blonde.
What is this feeling,
So sudden and new?
I felt the moment
I laid eyes on you;
My pulse is rushing;
My head is reeling;
My face is flushing;
What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame,
Does it have a name?
Yes! Loathing
Unadulterated loathing
For your face;
Your voice;
Your clothing;
Let's just say - I loathe it all
Ev'ry little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure and strong!
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you
My whole life long!
Dear Glinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could!
She's a terror! She's a Tartar!
We don't mean to show a bias,
But Glinda, you're a martyr!
Well; these things are sent to try us!
Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We all just want to tell you:
We're all on your side!
We share your;
What is this feeling 
So sudden and new? 
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you 
My pulse is rushing
My head is reeling 
Oh, what is this feeling? 
Does it have a name? 
Yes
Ahhh
Loathing
Unadultereated loathing
For her face, her voice, her clothing
let's just say - we loathe it all
ev'ry little trait however small
makes our very flesh being to crawl
AHHH!
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation 
It's So pure, so strong 
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last 
And I will be...
Truly deeply loathing you
loathing you
My whole Life long! 
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing
Elphie - now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project.
You really don't have to do that!
I know.
That's what makes me so nice!
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I.
And let's face it - who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over.
I know, I know, exactly what they need
And even in your case - tho' it's the toughest case I've yet to face, don't worry - I'm determined to succeed.
Follow my lead, and yes, indeed you will be popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper ploys
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce
I'll show you what shoes to wear
How to fix your hair
Everything that really counts
To be popular
I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go:
Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to be come a pal, a
Sister and adviser
There's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to popular -
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll bee
Instead of dreary who-you-were: are:
There's nothing that can stop you
From becoming popular
La la la la
We're gonna make
You popular
When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf
To think of 
Celebrated heads of state or
Specially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!
They were popular! Please -
It's all about popular!
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
Like me!
Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.
You're welcome!
And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it
Your new found popularity
La la la la
You'll be popular -
Just not as quite as popular
As me!
